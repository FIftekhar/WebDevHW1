                Hi! My name is Irteza Ali and I'm a senior at Hunter College studying computer science.
                I'm 21 years old and my family is from Bangladesh. Scroll down to learn more about me!

                One of my earliest hobbies had been playing video games. I got involved at an early age 
                (around the age of 5 or 6) and I've continued playing them to this day. This hobby served
                as a spark for my interests in game design and eventually in computer science. More interests
                that I later developed were in sports such as basketball, soccer and football and as well as cars.
